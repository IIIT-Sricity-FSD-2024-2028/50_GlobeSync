## GlobeSync – Travel Itinerary Planning & Coordination Platform

Modern travel planning involves multiple services such as transport, accommodation, guides, and customer support operating at the same time. When itinerary details, provider confirmations, and traveler communications are managed in a fragmented way, it leads to confusion, double bookings, and poor travel experience.

A centralized **Travel Itinerary Planning and Coordination Platform** is required to maintain a single structured itinerary, coordinate between different stakeholders, and handle real-time changes like delays or cancellations. The system supports traveler planning, guide collaboration, external service confirmation, and customer care assistance. By maintaining proper logs, notifications, and support workflows, the platform ensures smooth trip execution and reliable coordination across all actors.
